		<h1>“Lending live voice to the plays that now lie silent on our bookshelves”</h1><br>
		<h2>Endangered Species Theatre Project</h2><br>
		<p>Founded in 2011 by a group of esteemed Seattle directors and
		actors, ESTP brings great plays to life in elegantly staged readings.
		Infrequently or never before produced in Seattle, these vigorous
		works have been neglected due to their large casts or heavy scenic
		requirements – or having unjustly fallen out of cultural memory.</p>
		
		<p>ESTP each month gathers distinguished local theatre
		artists eager to explore the genius of playwrights such as
		Sidney Kingsley, Jean Giraudoux, Lorraine Hansberry, Arthur
		Schnitzler, J. M. Barrie, Enid Bagnold, Bertholt Brecht,
		George Bernard Shaw, Noël Coward, Lillian Hellman, and George
		S. Kaufman, to name just a few.  We and our audiences are
		constantly reminded that the great plays speak as
		dramatically and touchingly as they ever did, showing us the
		continuum of the human condition.</p>
